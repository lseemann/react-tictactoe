# React Tic Tac Toe
React is overkill for tic-tac-toe about 200kb heavier than vanilla JavaScriptâ€”but it was a fun way to learn some of the framework, and I was curious whether the logic from [my original code](https://github.com/lseemann/tictactoe) could be ported over without modification. (It could.)
